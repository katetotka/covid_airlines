# [The content of the dataset](https://github.com/katetotka/covid_airlines/blob/main/ColumnDescriptions.txt)
This dataset tracks the on-time performance of flights operated by large air carriers in USA. The data collected is from January - June 2020 and contains relevant flight information (on-time, delayed, canceled, diverted flights) from the Top 10 United States flight carriers for 11 million flights. Data is in 47 columns with full column descriptions in the attached .txt file.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
In this project an attempt is made to make a brief EDA of the above dataset. Through the use of the r language and some of its packages (tidyverse, ggplot2) the following questions are answered:

1. Which is the number of flights each month in descending order?
2.  Which day during the recording period there were the most delays?
3.  Which airport had the most arrivals between 12.00-14.00)?
4.  Which was the flight with the maximum distance and  how was its average delay in minutes?
5.  Which was the average daily delay of each air carrier?
6.  Which were the reasons for flight cancellation for each day of the month?
7.  What was the route (flight) with the most type D cancellations (D = Security)?
8.  Which was generally the most popular destination?
9.  Which were the 6 airports that had the most traffic during the months January-February?
10. Which was the total number of flights canceled during the period March-May? If we consider that each flight can accommodate 200 passengers and that the ticket is 100 euros to find the total cost.
